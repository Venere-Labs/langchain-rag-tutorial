# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Common questions about LangChain RAG Tutorial.

## General Questions

### What is RAG?

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** combines:

- **Retrieval**: Finding relevant documents from a knowledge base
- **Generation**: Using an LLM to generate answers based on retrieved context

**Benefits:**

- Up-to-date information (vs static training data)
- Source attribution (cite documents)
- Reduced hallucinations (grounded in facts)

### Which architecture should I choose?

| If you need... | Use this | Notebook |
|---|---|---|
| Fast, simple Q&A | Simple RAG | [03_simple_rag.ipynb](../notebooks/fundamentals/03_simple_rag.ipynb) |
| Chatbot with memory | Memory RAG | [04_rag_with_memory.ipynb](../notebooks/advanced_architectures/04_rag_with_memory.ipynb) |
| Comprehensive research | Branched RAG or Fusion RAG | [05_branched_rag.ipynb](../notebooks/advanced_architectures/05_branched_rag.ipynb) |
| Ambiguous queries | HyDE | [06_hyde.ipynb](../notebooks/advanced_architectures/06_hyde.ipynb) |
| Mixed workload / cost optimization | Adaptive RAG | [07_adaptive_rag.ipynb](../notebooks/advanced_architectures/07_adaptive_rag.ipynb) |
| High accuracy with web fallback | Corrective RAG (CRAG) | [08_corrective_rag.ipynb](../notebooks/advanced_architectures/08_corrective_rag.ipynb) |
| Self-correcting system | Self-RAG | [09_self_rag.ipynb](../notebooks/advanced_architectures/09_self_rag.ipynb) |
| Complex multi-step reasoning | Agentic RAG | [10_agentic_rag.ipynb](../notebooks/advanced_architectures/10_agentic_rag.ipynb) |
| Technical documentation | Contextual RAG | [12_contextual_rag.ipynb](../notebooks/advanced_architectures/12_contextual_rag.ipynb) |
| Best ranking quality | Fusion RAG | [13_fusion_rag.ipynb](../notebooks/advanced_architectures/13_fusion_rag.ipynb) |
| Analytics/BI queries | SQL RAG | [14_sql_rag.ipynb](../notebooks/advanced_architectures/14_sql_rag.ipynb) |

| Images + text | Multimodal RAG | [17_multimodal_rag.ipynb](../notebooks/advanced_architectures/17_multimodal_rag.ipynb) |
| Domain-specific retrieval | Fine-tuned embeddings | [18_finetuning_embeddings.ipynb](../notebooks/advanced_architectures/18_finetuning_embeddings.ipynb) |
| Quality evaluation | RAGAS | [16_evaluation_ragas.ipynb](../notebooks/advanced_architectures/16_evaluation_ragas.ipynb) |

**Rule of thumb:** start with Simple RAG, add Contextual RAG for quality, then move to a specialized architecture for specific needs.

**Tip:** if retrieval accuracy on domain-specific content stays below about 75%, consider fine-tuning embeddings (notebook 18); the notebook reports gains of 15-25%.

### Do I need an OpenAI account?

**Yes, for this tutorial:**

- OpenAI API key required for GPT-4o-mini
- Minimum $5 credit recommended
- Tutorial costs ~$0.10-$0.50 total

**Alternatives:**

- Use HuggingFace embeddings (local, free)
- Use open-source LLMs (Ollama, Llama)
- Modify notebooks to use different providers

### Can I use this in production?

**Yes, but consider:**

- Cost monitoring and optimization
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Caching strategies
- Security (API key management)
- Load testing at your expected scale
- Whether the architecture meets your latency requirements

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for production setup.

## Installation & Setup

### What Python version do I need?

**Supported:** Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13. Python 3.9 is not supported: it is end-of-life and LangChain 1.x requires Python 3.10+.

Check version:

```bash
python --version
```

### How much disk space is needed?

**Total: ~1.5GB**

- Dependencies: 500MB
- Virtual environment: 900MB
- HuggingFace model: 90MB (optional)
- Vector stores: 1-5MB

### Can I run this on Google Colab?

**Yes!** No local installation needed.

```python
# In Colab notebook
!git clone https://github.com/gianlucamazza/langchain-rag-tutorial.git
%cd langchain-rag-tutorial
!pip install -q -r requirements.txt

# Add API key via Colab Secrets
from google.colab import userdata
import os
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = userdata.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

## Cost & Performance

### How much does it cost to run?

**One-time costs:**

- Embeddings: ~$0.02 (10,000 documents)

**Per-query costs:**

- Simple RAG: $0.00036 per query
- Agentic RAG: $0.00360 per query

**Full tutorial:** $0.10-$0.50 total

See [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md) for detailed breakdown.

### How long does it take to complete?

| Component | Time |
|---|---|
| Setup | 10 min |
| Fundamentals (01-03) | 30-40 min |
| One advanced architecture | 12-30 min |
| All advanced notebooks (04-18) | 4-5 hours |
| With evaluation (RAGAS) | +20 min |
| **Total** | **5-7 hours** |

**First run is slower** (model downloads, vector store creation, Chinook DB).

### Why is the first run so slow?

**Expected behavior:**

1. **HuggingFace model download**: ~90MB (one-time)
2. **Document embedding**: 8-10 min (one-time)
3. **Vector store creation**: Creates FAISS indexes

**Subsequent runs:** 10x faster (uses cached data)

### How can I speed things up?

**Quick wins:**

1. Run notebook 02 or `make vector-stores` first (creates vector stores)
2. Use cached vector stores (load, don't recreate)
3. Reduce k=2 (retrieve fewer documents)
4. Use HuggingFace embeddings (local, no API calls)

See [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md) for optimization strategies.

## Technical Questions

### What's the difference between OpenAI and HuggingFace embeddings?

| Feature | OpenAI | HuggingFace |
|---|---|---|
| **Dimensions** | 1536 | 384 |
| **Quality** | Excellent | Good |
| **Cost** | $0.02/1M tokens | FREE |
| **Latency** | 100-200ms (API) | 500-1000ms (CPU) |
| **Offline** | No | Yes |

**Recommendation:** OpenAI for production, HuggingFace for demos/development.

### What is FAISS?

**FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search):

- Vector similarity search library
- Fast nearest neighbor search
- Supports billions of vectors
- Used by Facebook, Google, etc.

**In this tutorial:**

- Stores document embeddings
- Enables fast retrieval (milliseconds)
- Persists to disk (no re-embedding)

### Do I need a GPU?

**No!** This tutorial runs on CPU.

**GPU helps with:**

- Faster local embeddings (HuggingFace)
- Large-scale production deployments

**Not needed for:**

- Tutorial completion
- OpenAI API calls (server-side)

### Can I use my own documents?

**Yes.** Load them with a LangChain document loader and split them with the shared helpers:

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader, TextLoader

# Load your documents
loader = TextLoader("path/to/your/docs.txt")
# or
loader = PyPDFLoader("path/to/your/docs.pdf")

docs = loader.load()
chunks = split_documents(docs)
```

Then create vector store as usual.

## Architecture-Specific

### When should I use Contextual RAG?

**Use Contextual RAG when:**

- Working with technical documentation
- Code documentation needs context
- Legal/policy documents where context matters
- Chunks need document-level understanding

**How it works:**

```
Original: "The function returns a list of tokens."
Contextualized: "Document: LangChain API | Section: Text Splitting | The function returns a list of tokens."
Result: better semantic matching with 15-30% quality improvement
```

**Benefits:** ~15-30% better retrieval quality with minimal cost overhead.

### When should I use Fusion RAG?

**Use Fusion RAG when:**

- Ranking quality is critical
- Research and literature review
- Complex multi-aspect queries
- Need best-in-class result aggregation

**How it works:**

1. Generate 3-5 query perspectives
2. Retrieve documents for each query
3. Combine results using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)
4. Documents appearing in multiple result sets rank higher

**Trade-off:** ~3x slower than Simple RAG, but best ranking quality.

### When should I use SQL RAG?

**Use SQL RAG when:**

- Querying structured databases (SQL)
- Business intelligence and analytics
- Data exploration tools
- Natural language to SQL conversion

**How it works:**

1. User asks: "Show top customers by revenue"
2. Retrieve relevant database schema
3. Generate SQL with validation
4. Execute safely (read-only)
5. Interpret results with LLM

**Benefits:** Perfect accuracy for structured data queries. Includes Chinook sample database.

### When should I use GraphRAG?

**Use GraphRAG when:**

- Building knowledge graphs
- Relationship-centric queries ("Who works with whom?")
- Multi-hop reasoning ("Friend of a friend")
- Network analysis and community detection

**How it works:**

1. Extract entities from documents
2. Extract relationships between entities
3. Build NetworkX graph
4. Query graph with traversal algorithms
5. Visualize with matplotlib

**Trade-off:** More complex setup, but excellent for relationship queries.

### When should I use HyDe?

**Use HyDe when:**

- Queries are ambiguous or vague
- Technical jargon needs translation
- Semantic matching is more important than keyword matching

**Example:**

```
Query: "How do I make my RAG faster?"
HyDe generates: "To optimize RAG performance, use vector store caching, reduce k parameter, and implement batch processing..."
Then embeds hypothetical answer for better retrieval.
```

### What's the difference between CRAG and Self-RAG?

| Feature | CRAG | Self-RAG |
|---|---|---|
| **Focus** | Document quality | Retrieval necessity |
| **Grading** | Relevance grader | Retrieval need classifier |
| **Fallback** | Web search | Re-retrieve |
| **Iterations** | 1 | 1-3 |
| **Use Case** | Out-of-domain queries | Self-correcting system |

### Why is Agentic RAG so slow?

**Agentic RAG uses ReAct pattern:**

1. **Think**: Analyze query
2. **Act**: Select tool (retriever, calculator, web)
3. **Observe**: Examine result
4. **Repeat**: Until answer found

**Each iteration = 1-2 LLM calls**
**Total**: 5-10 LLM calls, 20-40s latency

**Trade-off**: Slow but autonomous multi-step reasoning.
