# Advanced RAG Architectures

This directory contains notebooks 04-20: **14 advanced RAG architectures**, each suited to different use cases and requirements, plus a comparison benchmark, a RAGAS evaluation framework and an embedding fine-tuning guide.

## Prerequisites

Before exploring advanced architectures, complete the fundamentals:

1. `fundamentals/01_setup_and_basics.ipynb`
2. `fundamentals/02_embeddings_comparison.ipynb`
3. `fundamentals/03_simple_rag.ipynb`

These provide the baseline components (vector stores, embeddings, retrievers) used by all advanced architectures. Alternatively, build the vector stores with `make vector-stores` from the project root.

### 16_evaluation_ragas.ipynb

**RAGAS Evaluation Framework**

Comprehensive quality assessment for RAG systems using 6 evaluation metrics.

**When to Use:**

- Benchmarking multiple architectures

- A/B testing RAG improvements
- Cost-quality trade-off analysis

**Key Metrics:**

1. **Faithfulness**: Answer grounded in context?
2. **Answer Relevancy**: Response addresses the question?
3. **Context Precision**: Relevant chunks ranked high?
4. **Context Recall**: All needed info retrieved?
5. **Answer Similarity**: Semantic match with ground truth?
6. **Answer Correctness**: Factual accuracy score

**Example Evaluation:**

```
Test Dataset:
- Question: "What is RAG?"
- Ground Truth: "RAG is Retrieval-Augmented Generation..."
- Context: [retrieved chunks]
- Answer: [generated response]

Scores:
- Faithfulness: 0.95 (well-grounded)
- Relevancy: 0.92 (on-topic)
- Precision: 0.88 (good retrieval)
- Recall: 0.85 (mostly complete)
- Similarity: 0.90 (semantically close)
- Correctness: 0.93 (factually accurate)
```

**Duration:** ~20 minutes

### 19_hybrid_search_reranking.ipynb

**Hybrid Search + Cross-Encoder Reranking**

Combines keyword retrieval (BM25) with dense retrieval (FAISS) through weighted Reciprocal Rank Fusion, then reranks the fused candidates with a local cross-encoder before they reach the LLM.

**When to Use:**

- Queries that mix natural language with identifiers (API names, error codes, SKUs)
- Corpora with domain jargon the embedding model has not seen
- When precision of the top few chunks matters more than a few hundred ms of latency

**Key Components:**

- `BM25Retriever` + FAISS combined with `EnsembleRetriever` (weighted RRF)
- `ContextualCompressionRetriever` + `CrossEncoderReranker` (`cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`, set with `DEFAULT_RERANKER_MODEL`)
- Dense / BM25 / Hybrid / Hybrid+Rerank comparison with Hit@4 and MRR@4 on exact-identifier vs paraphrased queries
- `bm25_weight` sweep and inspection of reranker scores
- Reusable builders in `shared/retrievers.py`

**Example:**

```
Query: "What does max_retries control?"

Dense:  semantically close chunks, exact token often missed
BM25:   chunks containing "max_retries"
Hybrid: RRF merges both rankings (~20 candidates)
Rerank: cross-encoder scores each (query, chunk) pair -> top 4
```

No extra API key is needed; the first run downloads the reranker model (~90 MB).

**Duration:** ~15 minutes

---

### 20_parent_multivector_retrieval.ipynb

**Parent-Document and Multi-Vector Retrieval**

Separates what is searched from what is returned to the LLM: a vector store holds the searchable vectors, a docstore holds the text the LLM reads.

**When to Use:**

- Answers need more context than a small, precisely matching chunk provides
- Users ask questions in words the text does not use
- Dense chunks (code, tables) that embed poorly as raw text

**Key Components:**

- `ParentDocumentRetriever`: 400-char child chunks are embedded, 2000-char parents are returned
- `MultiVectorRetriever`: indexes an LLM summary and 3 hypothetical questions per chunk (`with_structured_output`), returns the original chunk
- Generated representations cached in `data/cache/`
- Comparison with the baseline on Hit@4, MRR@4 and context size

**Example:**

```
Chunk: "RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200) ..."

Indexed representations:
- Summary: "Configuring chunk size and overlap for text splitting"
- Question: "How do I control the size of text chunks?"
- Question: "What does chunk_overlap do?"

-> A question-shaped query matches a question-shaped vector; the LLM gets the original chunk
```

**Duration:** ~15 minutes

## Shared Dependencies

All notebooks reuse components from `fundamentals`:

```python
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

from shared import RAG_PROMPT_TEMPLATE, HYDE_PROMPT, require_vector_store
from shared.config import OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL, OPENAI_VECTOR_STORE_PATH
from shared.prompts import MEMORY_RAG_PROMPT

# Shared artifacts (data/vector_stores/openai__<OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL>)
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model=OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL)
vectorstore_openai = require_vector_store(OPENAI_VECTOR_STORE_PATH, embeddings)
```

This avoids redundant embedding computation and ensures consistent baselines.

---

## Production Considerations

Before deploying any advanced architecture:

1. **Cost Analysis**: Track token usage with `tiktoken`
2. **Latency Monitoring**: Profile each component
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust fallbacks
4. **Caching**: Cache embeddings and frequent queries
5. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API overuse
6. **Logging**: Use LangSmith for tracing

See each notebook's "Production Optimizations" section for specific guidance.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "Vector store not found"

- **Solution**: Run `fundamentals/02_embeddings_comparison.ipynb` or `make vector-stores` first

**Issue**: "Module 'shared' not found"

- **Solution**: Ensure you're in the project root or adjust `sys.path`

**Issue**: "Rate limit exceeded"

- **Solution**: Add delays between API calls or use batch processing

**Issue**: "Tavily search fails"

- **Solution**: Check that `TAVILY_API_KEY` is set in `.env` and `langchain-tavily` is installed

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](../../docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for the full guide.
